# TimeLapse-App
A cross-platform mobile application built on React Native. Focused on time-lapsing, this app will be attempt to implement an auto-ramp feature programmatically.


# Developer Notes
1. The **@coffeebeanslabs/react-native-inviewport** module needs an [update](https://github.com/yamill/react-native-inviewport/pull/12/files) to prevent React from setState on unmounted component.

Any additional issues regarding expo or node modules can be posted here.
